# Business-Understanding: 

Microsoft Studios
Building a strategy to make money in the film industry by looking at foreign and domestic values, production budgets and studios.

- Approach
  - We want to be profitable and make money
Comparing production costs to gross costs to see if there is any trend between money spent and money earned. Is there more money to be made in the domestic zone, foreign zone or both? Analyzing how other studios handle their investments and what works well for them, what is the tried and tested model and how can we replicate that?

- Thesis Questions
  - Question - Do successful movies trend more towards foreign or domestic markets? (Sum Domestic VS Sum Foreign)
    -  domestic_gross
    -  foreign_gross
    -  Extra - Profit(Gross - Budget, Mean of Difference)

  - Question - production_budget against worldwide_gross (If I spend more money will it make more money)
    - production_budget
    - worldwide_gross

  - Question - Is there a studio that seems to attract a certain level of success?
    - Studios
    - Mean worldwide gross
    - Extra - Profit(Gross - Budget, Mean of Difference, list against studio)
  - Question - Is there an amount spend in the budget that studios don't exceed OR Is there a direct relationship to amount spent in production Vs. How much is actually made?|
